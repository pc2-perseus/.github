## What is PERSEUS?

> PERSEUS is currently in beta. Some features are still experimental and maybe don't work as expected.
> Feel free to reach out to us and share you experiences and feedback: https://perseus-project.pc2.uni-paderborn.de/contact/

PERSEUS is a compute project management software for scientific HPC centers. It allows you to
* professionalize your workflows
* deploy center-wide automation
* fully customize workflow items (states), (micro)services and reports

## Getting Started

There are multiple ways to run PERSEUS.
You can either use our automated installer scripts or deploy it manually using Docker or Podman.

### Installer & Updater

If you prefer an automated setup that installs all dependencies and configures the environment for you, we provide installer scripts that set up **Docker or Podman**, along with **Nginx** and required configuration files.

Compared to the manual `docker-compose` approach, the installer scripts offer a **more opinionated**, out-of-the-box experience ‚Äì ideal for quick testing, small-scale deployments, or first-time users.

We currently offer two variants:

* [`installer-docker.sh`](https://github.com/pc2-perseus/perseus/blob/main/installer-docker.sh) ‚Äì for Docker-based setups (requires root)
* [`installer-podman.sh`](https://github.com/pc2-perseus/perseus/blob/main/installer-podman.sh) ‚Äì for Podman-based setups (runs containers as a dedicated non-root user)

> The scripts support most major Linux distributions and will automatically detect your package manager.

To keep your deployment up to date, we also provide:

* [`updater-docker.sh`](https://github.com/pc2-perseus/perseus/blob/main/updater-docker.sh)
* [`updater-podman.sh`](https://github.com/pc2-perseus/perseus/blob/main/updater-podman.sh)

These update scripts stop the running containers, pull the latest images, restart the services, and clean up unused resources.

üìñ Read more about the installer workflow in our
[**official documentation**](https://perseus-project.pc2.uni-paderborn.de/installation/use_install_script/)

### Run via Docker

We also provide a ready-to-use [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/pc2-perseus/perseus/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to run PERSEUS using **Docker** or **Podman**.

Our prebuilt container images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pc2upb).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This approach requires you to set up a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy) yourself to route requests to the frontend and backend containers. We recommend serving the API under '/api' and the frontend at '/'.
